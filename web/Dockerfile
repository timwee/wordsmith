# Many packages "want" some configuration information.
# (For instance, the tzdata package wants to know in
# which timezone we are, to set the TZ environment
# variable accordingly.)
# On Debian/Ubuntu, this configuration is managed by
# debconf. The following line prevents debconf from
# asking questions on the terminal (the default), which
# wouldn't work in a Dockerfile, since Dockerfile must
# not interact with the user (since there might not be
# an user to interact with).

# (Not the best way to do it! But it will do for now.)

# Compile the Go program as instructed.

RUN go build dispatcher.go

# Using the exec syntax (JSON list of strings) makes
# sure that "dispatcher" will be PID 1, and will therefore
# receive signals correctly (allowing Ctrl-C to work
# correctly, for instance).
